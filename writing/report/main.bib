  abstract = {This chapter discusses that constraint reasoning involves various types of techniques to tackle the inherent intractability of the problem of satisfying a set of constraints. Constraint propagation is one of those types of techniques. It is central to the process of solving a constraint problem and indispensable for constraint reasoning. The chapter examines that constraint propagation embeds any reasoning, which consists in explicitly forbidding values or combinations of values for some variables of a problem, because a given subset of its constraints cannot be satisfied otherwise. It is in constraint reasoning that this concept shows its most accomplished form. There is no other field in which the concept of constraint propagation appears in such a variety of forms, and in which its characteristics have been analyzed. The chapter reviews that it formalizes all constraint propagation approaches within a unifying framework and discusses the main existing types of constraint propagation.},

  abstract = {Bitmap indexes are commonly used in databases and search engines. By exploiting bit-level parallelism, they can significantly accelerate queries. However, they can use much memory, and thus we might prefer compressed bitmap indexes. Following Oracle's lead, bitmaps are often compressed using run-length encoding (RLE). Building on prior work, we introduce the Roaring compressed bitmap format: it uses packed arrays for compression instead of RLE. We compare it to two high-performance RLE-based bitmap encoding techniques: WAH (Word Aligned Hybrid compression scheme) and Concise (Compressed `n' Composable Integer Set). On synthetic and real data, we find that Roaring bitmaps (1) often compress significantly better (e.g., 2{\texttimes}) and (2) are faster than the compressed alternatives (up to 900{\texttimes} faster for intersections). Our results challenge the view that RLE-based bitmap compression is best.},

  abstract = {Fast compilation is important when compilation occurs at runtime, such as query compilers in modern database systems and WebAssembly virtual machines in modern browsers. We present copy-and-patch, an extremely fast compilation technique that also produces good quality code. It is capable of lowering both high-level languages and low-level bytecode programs to binary code, by stitching together code from a large library of binary implementation variants. We call these binary implementations stencils because they have holes where missing values must be inserted during code generation. We show how to construct a stencil library and describe the copy-and-patch algorithm that generates optimized binary code. We demonstrate two use cases of copy-and-patch: a compiler for a high-level C-like language intended for metaprogramming and a compiler for WebAssembly. Our high-level language compiler has negligible compilation cost: it produces code from an AST in less time than it takes to construct the AST. We have implemented an SQL database query compiler on top of this metaprogramming system and show that on TPC-H database benchmarks, copy-and-patch generates code two orders of magnitude faster than LLVM -O0 and three orders of magnitude faster than higher optimization levels. The generated code runs an order of magnitude faster than interpretation and 14\% faster than LLVM -O0. Our WebAssembly compiler generates code 4.9X-6.5X faster than Liftoff, the WebAssembly baseline compiler in Google Chrome. The generated code also outperforms Liftoff's by 39\%-63\% on the Coremark and PolyBenchC WebAssembly benchmarks.},

In addition, bidirectional typing improves error locality.

A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety. We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm W which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot ``go wrong'' and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if W accepts a program then it is well typed. We also discuss extending these results to richer languages; a type-checking algorithm based on W is in fact already implemented and working, for the metalanguage ML in the Edinburgh LCF system.},

It is common in mathematical practice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to identify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this common practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups in set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other hand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that accommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what it means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of's dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent mathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point of view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic reasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior familiarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach to incremental recovery from lexical and syntactic errors in an interactive software development environment. Unlike existing techniques, we utilize the history of changes to the program to discover the natural correlation between user modifications and errors detected during incremental lexical and syntactic analysis. Our technique is non-correcting---the analysis refuses to incorporate invalid modifications, while still permitting correct changes to be applied. Errors are presented to the user simply by highlighting the invalid changes. The approach is automated---no user action is required to detect or recover from errors. Multiple textual and structural edits, arbitrary timing of incremental analysis, multiple errors per analysis, and nested errors are supported. Historybased error recovery is language independent and is compatible with the best known methods for incremental lexing and parsing, adding neither time nor space overhead to those algorithms. Effective integration with the environment's history services ensures that other tools can efficiently discover regions of the program (un)affected by errors, and that any transformations of the program required to isolate or present errors are themselves efficiently reversible operations.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new language, called AR (Action Rules), and describe how various propagators for finite-domain constraints can be implemented in it. An action rule specifies a pattern for agents, an action that the agents can carry out, and an event pattern for events that can activate the agents. AR combines the goal-oriented execution model of logic programming with the event-driven execution model. This hybrid execution model facilitates programming constraint propagators. A propagator for a constraint is an agent that maintains the consistency of the constraint and is activated by the updates of the domain variables in the constraint. AR has a much stronger descriptive power than indexicals, the language widely used in the current finite-domain constraint systems, and is flexible for implementing not only interval-consistency but also arc-consistency algorithms. As examples, we present a weak arc-consistency propagator for the all distinct constraint and a hybrid algorithm for n-ary linear equality constraints. B-Prolog has been extended to accommodate action rules. Benchmarking shows that B-Prolog as a CLP(FD) system significantly outperforms other CLP(FD) systems.},
