# Sunstone

Sunstone is a library for representing large sets of integers, and computing arithmetic operations between all elements of these sets. For example, it may be used to compute `{1, 3, 6} + {10, 15, 20} = {11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 26 }`.

_a note about the name_: Sunstones represent joy and confidence. Nothing about this library's implementation should spark joy, and it cerrtainly does not inspire confidence.
